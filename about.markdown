<h2>Who am I?</h2>

In 2024 (April), I obtained my PhD degree at the University of Ghent, Belgium (UGent) in the <a href="https://kermit.ugent.be/" target="_blank">KERMIT</a> research group (more specifically, the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://willemwaegeman.github.io/bioml/">BioML</a> research group) under the supervision of Prof. De Baets and Prof. Waegeman. I started in February 2020 (just before Covid-19 hit), and my main research topic was Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).

Currently, I am working as a financial consultant at EY Belgium in the FSO Risk department.

In my spare time, I also enjoy the occasional boulder session (indoor and outdoor).

In September 2014, I started a Bachelor of Science in Physics & Astronomy at UGent. After 5 years, I succesfully obtained my Master's degree with a thesis on "Spatial Symmetries and Symmetry Breaking with Matrix Product States" under supervision of Prof. Frank Verstraete. This thesis is situated in the branch of theoretical physics and most of my current academic interests are still strongly tied to that topic. In particular, I am interested in the following topics (the list is not exhaustive):

* Topology (algebraic topology, cohomology theory, homotopy theory, ...)
* Differential Geometry (manifolds, bundle theory, ...)
* Category Theory (higher structures, topos theory, ...)

Although for most people, these might only superficially be related, they all play a very important roll in the area of <i>gauge theory</i> in theoretical physics. (This should be explained in a future blogpost.)
