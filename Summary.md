During my second Bachelor year, I started writing down everything I found useful or interesting. This 'compendium' quickly grew and, by now, reached monstrous proportions.

<div class = "note">
    <u>Disclaimer</u>: For all chapters and/or sections, reference are provided and it are only these references that should be trusted. The compendium itself might and, without a doubt, will still contain numerous errors. It should only be used as a guide through the literature. (See it as a summary as provided by GPT-like models, with the exception that I did ponder what I wrote down.)
