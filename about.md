<h2>Who am I?</h2>

In September 2014, I started a Bachelor of Science in Physics & Astronomy at the University of Ghent, Belgium (UGent). After 5 years, I succesfully obtained my Master's degree with a thesis on "Spatial Symmetries and Symmetry Breaking with Matrix Product States" under supervision of Prof. Frank Verstraete. This thesis is situated in theoretical (condensed matter) physics and most of my current academic interests are still strongly tied to that topic.<br><br>

In April 2024, I obtained my PhD degree at the University of Ghent, Belgium (UGent) in the <a href="https://kermit.ugent.be/" target="_blank">KERMIT</a> research group (more specifically, the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://willemwaegeman.github.io/bioml/">BioML</a> research group) under the supervision of Prof. De Baets and Prof. Waegeman. I started in February 2020 (just before Covid-19 hit), and my main research topic was Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).

<br>

Currently, I am working as a financial consultant at EY Belgium in the FSO Risk department. I am also a cofounder of <a href = "https://tumaini-vzw.github.io/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">VZW Tumaini Heart For Kids</a>.

In my spare time, I enjoy the occasional boulder session (indoor and outdoor) or tennis/squash game.

Working on the intersection of machine learning and statistics, with a strong focus on statistical guarantees for uncertainty modelling. Personally, I am interested in the interplay of probability theory, statistics and (the theoretical framework of) machine learning.<br><br>

In line with my prior education, I am still interested in (theoretical) physics, in particular gauge theory and category theory, and all subjects related to this. More generally, I am also fascinated by the role these subjects play in other branches of science such as data science, biology, philosophy, etc. In particular, I am interested in the following topics (the list is not exhaustive):

* Topology (cohomology theory, homotopy theory, ...)
* Differential Geometry (manifolds, bundles, ...)
* Category Theory ($n$-categories, topos theory, ...)

Although for most people, these might only superficially be related, they all play a very important roll in the area of <i>gauge theory</i> in theoretical physics. (This should be explained in a future blogpost.)

I am currently reading (or have started reading in the past) the following books:
* <i>The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe</i> by Steven Weinberg
* <i>The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect</i> by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie
* <i>Helgoland: Making Sense of the Quantum Revolution</i> by Carlo Rovelli
* <i>Waarom niemand kwantum begrijpt en iedereen er toch iets over moet weten</i> by Frank Verstraete and CÃ©line Broeckaert
* <i>Relativiteitstheorie: Van stationsklokken tot de big bang</i> by Karel Van Acoleyen
