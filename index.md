<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>

<div class = "note" style = "text-align: center">
    This site is still under development. It has recently been ported to a Jekyll build.
</div>

I started building this site for two reasons. First of all, because I like trying something new and it had been years since I last toyed around with website building. Secondly, because I wanted a place where I could share my academic interests with the rest of the world. I am well aware that I will probably not reach a lot of people, but even if nobody reads my blogs, it still makes for a nice place to write up stuff for myself and find out what I still do not fully understand.<br><br>

I am using MathJax to typeset all equations so as to obtain a nice LateX feel. As a test, the <i>Dirac action</i> on a general <i>spin manifold</i> should be nicely rendered here:

$$S_\text{Dirac}[\psi] := \int_M \bar{\psi}(i/\!\!\!\partial-m)\psi\,\mathrm{Vol}_M\,.$$

However, not all operators or packages are implemented in MathJax, so it is possible that certain formulas do not look as clean as they would when using ordinary $\LaTeX$.
