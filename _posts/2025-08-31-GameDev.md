A story about childhood dreams, a love for software development and some funky mathematics.

In my fifth year of high school, I had to choose between taking two hours of applied sciences or two hours of mathematics and programming on top of the regular mathematics and science curriculum. The programming part was about the basics of <tt>Java</tt> (through BlueJ[^1]). At that time, my father had already taught me some things about programming and had shown me some of the projects he had made in <tt>Delphi</tt> (a <tt>Pascal</tt> derivative). However, this was the real deal. It took a bit before I started enjoying it, but once I was able to play with it myself, I quickly learned how amazing programming was.<br><br>

My first project was developping a game. In the fifth year of primary school, during the last week of school, our teacher introduced us to the wonderful world of Age of Empires (AoE I to be specific). No wonder my first own game had to be something like Age of Empires: a real time strategy game. I started implementing unit and building classes, resource systems, graphics and an AI (clearly at that time this did not consist of much, but it worked!) I quickly got the support of two class mates and we worked on this project together for a while (adding multiplayer amongst other things). However, due to holiday breaks and, more importantly, at the end of the last year of high school, the change to university, this project fell apart.<br><br>

However, over the years, I often returned to this project. At some point, I tried to salvage the code I could recover from my high school days, but, sadly, this was to no avail. I had to (re)start from scratch. This blog post will cover my latest iteration, which covers a few years (be it with lengthy breaks). When I started learning <tt>Java</tt>, version (1.)7 was in use. At the time of writing, version (1.)24 is the latest one. Many things have changed and many improvements have been added to the language. This means that, after obtaining a PhD in statistics, which implies working with Python for 4 years (and more), I had to relearn a lot and also learned new things along the way. I selected a handful of topics that I want to cover in more detail, give my opinion about their use, and explain some relations to formal mathematics.
