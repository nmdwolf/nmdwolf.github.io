"This month's read" will cover some interesting, but fascinating concepts in field theory and the calculus of variations. Most physicists have encountered the notion of (Faddeev&ndash;Popov) 'ghost' at some point or another in there carreer and might have thought "What in the world is this? Do we really need this?" On the other hand, science aficionados might have encountered that same term in (popular) science news, where it is often depicted as some mysterious and magical thing. This post aims to clear up some of the mystery and explain why these objects are 'necessary' for a rigorous mathematical treatment of the subject.

The story starts with the treatment of constrained dynamics by Dirac. He found a way to elegantly incorporate constraints into the classical Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. Extending this formulation in an algebraic manner, quite naturally leads to the notion of 'ghosts', even in the particle setting, where the so-called <i>BRST formalism</i> is introduced most easily. Going beyond particles is then rather straight forward, although the Lagrangian treatment is more natural in this case (since field theories are often treated from the Lagrangian point of view, although a Hamiltonian formulation is still possible).<br><br>

At the same time, to formally treat variational problems and their subtleties, it will be necessary to pass beyond the classical geometry of phase spaces and enter the realm of <i>jet bundles</i>. The resulting structure will be a combination of the <i>variational bicomplex</i> and the <i>BV-BRST complex</i>. Although this might look like some casual name-dropping, all these notions will be made clear by the end of this post.

One of the foundational formulations of classical mechanics was introduced by Hamilton in 1833. The central object in this formulation is the Hamiltonian (function) $H:\mathbb{R}^{2n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, which depends on both the ordinary coordinates $q^i$ and their associated momenta $p_i$. To give an example, consider a particle moving in 3D. the coordinates are then $q^1=x$, $q^2=y$ and $q^3=z$, and the associated momenta are $p_1=mv_1$, $p_2=mv_2$ and $p_3=mv_3$. However, for more involved systems, such as those involving electromagnetism, these expression can change.<br><br>

But what about constraints of the form

$$\zeta(q,p)=0\,.$$

For example, in the point particle case, a pendulum attached to a rigid bar (of length $a\in\mathbb{R}^+$). This would be modeled by a constraint of the form

$$\zeta_{\text{pendulum}}(q,p) := r^2-a^2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2)-a^2\,.$$

Another example would be a solid wall (e.g. to the left of $x=0$). This would be modeled by a constraint of the form[^1]

$$\zeta_{\text{wall}}(q,p) := \begin{cases}+\infty & x<0\\ 0 & x\geq0\,.\end{cases}$$

[^1]: $+\infty$ could be replaced by any positive value without altering the final result (at least classically).

In the Lagrangian setting[^2], where we are simply minimizing (or extremizing) the action, these constraints are easily incorporated. We just have to replace the action

[^2]: Passing between the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian frameworks requires us to replace the canonical coordinates $(q,p)$ with the generalized coordinates $(q,\dot{q})$, but we will ignore this technicality.

$$S[q,\dot{q}] := \int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(q,\dot{q})\,dt$$

by the extended action

$$S[q,\dot{q},\lambda] := \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\Big(L(q,\dot{q}) + \sum_a\lambda_a\xi_a\Bigr)\,dt\,,$$

where the $\lambda_a$ are called Lagrange multipliers. The constraint equations then simply follow from the extremality conditions

$$\frac{\delta S}{\delta\lambda_a}=\xi_a=0\,.$$

All of this can also easily be done in the Hamiltonian framework, thereby opening up the study of Poisson geometry to the inclusion of constraints. Hamilton's equations of motion read

$$\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^i} = \dot{p}_i \qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}=-\dot{q}^i\,.$$

After introducing the <b>Poisson bracket</b>

$$\{f,g\} := \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}\frac{\partial g}{\partial q^i} - \frac{\partial g}{\partial p_i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}\,,$$

these equations can be rewritten as

$$\dot{p}_i = \{H,q^i\} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \dot{q}^i = \{H,p_i\}\,.$$

The constrained equations of motion are then generated by replacing the original Hamiltonian $H$ by the extended Hamiltonian

$$H_E(q,p,\lambda) := H(q,p) + \sum_a\lambda_a\xi_a(q,p)\,,$$

where the $\lambda_a$, which play a role similar to the Lagrange multipliers in the Lagrangian framework, are actually functions of $q$ and $\dot{q}$ (given suitable regularity conditions)!<br><br>

Dirac's remarkable insight was to not just stop here, but consider the consistency conditions on the constraint functions (and Lagrange multipliers) and study the algebraic structure that arises.
