Last month's post was about probability theory. This month's post will cover something completely different. Most people have heard about quantum mechanics and its implications for technology (in the form of quantum computing). What is less well known is the logical structure of the propositions that can be considered in quantum mechanics. 'Quantum logic', which is the type of logic that should come out of this consideration, has been studied since the days that quantum mechanics was formalized. However, pay attention to the word 'should' in the previous sentence. It turns out that the naive logic that one would extract is actually quite ill behaved.

This post is structured as follows:
1. Primer on quantum information theory
1. Birkhoff&ndash;Von Neumann logic a.k.a. quantum logic
1. Primer on Gentzen's sequent calculus
1. Linear logic
1. Interpretation in terms of resources
1. Categorical semantics of (linear) logic

In the first section, a short introduction to quantum information theory is given: quantum states, entanglement and some remarkable theorems.
Considering the natural structure of quantum mechanics quickly leads to a generalization of classical logic, which is the subject of the second section.<br><br>

For the readers that are primarily interested in quantum mechanics, the first two sections are the most relevant. Section 3 and onwards are of a more mathematical flavour but introduce a different type of logic that can be obtained when incorporating the core results of quantum information theory.<br><br>

Although the naive generalization of classical logic coming out of quantum mechanics might seem natural at first, it has some serious downsides and a different approach is followed in section 4, with the necessary mathematical background being introduced in Section 3. After the core ideas of linear logic have been introduced, Section 5 reformulates these concepts in terms of 'resources' and 'processes' as to shed a different, more practical light on the matter. To finish the main body of this post, Section 6 covers my personal favourite, the categorical semantics.

In quantum mechanics, everything revolves around state vectors $\lvert\psi\rangle$ in Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}$ and the operators $\widehat{O}\in\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{H})$ that act on them. An important construction in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory is the tensor product, which assembles separate quantum systems into one composite system:

$$\mathcal{H}_1,\mathcal{H}_2,\cdots,\mathcal{H}_n\longrightarrow\mathcal{H}_1\otimes\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathcal{H}_n\,.$$

Associated to this construction and the unitarity of quantum mechanical evolution (the Schr√∂dinger equation), there are two very important theorems: the no-cloning and no-deleting[^0] theorems.

[^0]: Also called the 'no-erasure' theorem.

<div class="theorem" text="No-cloning" markdown = "1">
  Consider a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. There exists no unitary operator $\widehat{U}\in\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H})$ such that

  $$\widehat{U}\bigl(\lvert\phi\rangle\lvert\psi\rangle\bigr) = e^{i\alpha(\phi,\psi)}\lvert\phi\rangle\lvert\phi\rangle$$

  for any two (normalized) states $\lvert\phi\rangle,\lvert\psi\rangle\in\mathcal{H}$.[^1]

  [^1]: The phase factor $e^{i\alpha(\phi,\psi)}$ is a consequence of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_Hilbert_space" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">projective nature</a> of quantum mechanics.
</div>

<div class="theorem" text="No-deleting">
  Consider two Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H},\mathcal{H}'$, where the latter can be interpreted as representing the 'machine'. If a unitary operator $\widehat{U}\in\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}')$ satisfies

  $$\widehat{U}\bigl(\lvert\psi\rangle\lvert\psi\rangle\lvert A\rvert\bigr) = \lvert\psi\rangle\lvert0\rangle\lvert A_\psi\rangle$$

  for all initial states $\lvert\psi\rangle\in\mathcal{H}$ and initial ancilla states $\lvert A\rangle\in\mathcal{H}'$, then the operation $\lvert A\rangle\mapsto\lvert A_\psi\rangle$ on the ancilla space is an isometric embedding, i.e. the second physical state can only be deleted, if the information is stored in the ancilla state.

<div class = "nav-block"><div class = "side">Birkhoff&ndash;Von Neumann logic</div></div>

  In classical logic, the set of propositions forms a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure)" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">Boolean algebra</a>. This means that one has a conjunction and disjunction (the logical 'and' $\land$ and 'or' $\lor$), a negation or complement ($\lnot$) and two constants ($\top$, $\bot$), representing <b id = "Truth">truth</b> and <b id = "Falsity">falsity</b>. These constants and operations satisfy a number of conditions such as distributivity (or, in logic, <b id = "deMorgansLaws">de Morgan's laws</b>):

  $$p\land (q\lor r) = (p\land q)\lor(p\land r) \qquad\qquad p\lor (q\land r) = (p\lor q)\land(p\lor r)\,.$$

  All these propositions (and the associated Boolean structure) can be represented using sets, namely the set $S_p$ representing the proposition $p$ is given by all elements that satisfy $p$. In quantum mechanics, one does not simply work with sets, but with subspaces, since, by the projection axiom of quantum mechanics, performing a measurement projects the state vector onto the subspace associated to the obtained eigenvalue.<br><br>

  Now, following Birkhoff and Von Neumann, if one considers the $\\{0,1\\}$-valued measurements as propositions in quantum theory, one finds that propositions are represented by projection operators, i.e. $\Pi^2=\Pi$. It can be shown that the set of projection operators or, equivalently, closed subspaces of Hilbert spaces forms a generalization of a Boolean algebra: an orthomodular lattice. However, because these lattices are nondistributive, it is hard to introduce a notion of implication or deduction and, as such, this gives rise to a very 'non-logic' theory. Moreover, there is no clear way to pass from this propositional form to a predicative form. A third issue, related to the probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics through the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">Born rule</a>, is that although the crisp statements about the value of a measurement cannot be made, the orthomodular lattice of quantum propositions does satisfy the law of the excluded middle.<br><br>

  To circumvent these issues, one needs a different, more general, type of logic!

<hr id = "SequentCalculus">
<div class = "nav-block"><div class = "side">Primer on sequent calculus</div></div>

  Gentzen, building on the work of Heyting, realized a very interesting fact. Intuitionistic logic could be recovered as a fragment of classical logic by removing the weakening and contraction rules on the right-hand side of sequents, i.e. by only considering sequents of the form
  
  $$\Gamma_1,\ldots,\Gamma_n\vdash\Theta\,.$$

  For linear logic, which will be introduced in the next section, weakening and contraction are completely removed.

<hr id = "LinearLogic">
<div class = "nav-block"><div class = "side">Linear logic</div></div>

  Whereas, as noted in the previous section, the sequent $\Gamma_1,\ldots,\Gamma_m\vdash\Theta_1,\ldots,\Theta_n$ to $\Gamma_1\land\cdots\land\Gamma_m\vdash\Theta_1\lor\cdots\lor\Theta_n$ in classical logic, this will become

  \begin{gather}
    \label{general_sequent}
    \Gamma_1,\ldots,\Gamma_m\vdash\Theta_1,\ldots,\Theta_n \iff \Gamma_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\Gamma_m\vdash\Theta_1\dualampersand\cdots\dualampersand\Theta_n
  \end{gather}

  in linear logic (i.e. the multiplicative connectives govern the basic rules).<br><br>

  The basic constructs of linear logic are as follows:

  <div class = "list-collapser" markdown = "1">
  
  * <b>Negation</b>: If $P$ is a proposition, so is $P^\ast$.

    (Although $\lnot P$ is a more common notation in logic, the asterisk will be used in this post. Both to highlight the difference between classical and linear logic and because of the categorical semantics which will be discussed <a href = "#CategoricalSemantics">further below</a>.)
  * <b>Connectives</b>: If $P,Q$ are propositions, then
      * <b>Additive conjunction</b>: $P\& Q$ is a proposition. (Read: $P$ <span style = "color: orange">with</span> $Q$.)
      * <b>Additive disjunction</b>: $P\oplus Q$ is a proposition. (Read: $P$ <span style = "color: orange">plus</span> $Q$.)
      * <b>Multiplicative conjunction</b>: $P\otimes Q$ is a proposition. (Read: $P$ <span style = "color: orange">times</span> $Q$.)
      * <b>Multiplicative disjunction</b>: $P\dualampersand Q$ is a proposition. (Read: $P$ <span style = "color: orange">par</span> $Q$.)
      * <b>Exponential conjunction</b>: $!P$ is a proposition. (Read: <span style = "color: orange">of course</span> $P$.)
      * <b>Exponential disjunction</b>: $?P$ is a proposition. (Read: <span style = "color: orange">why not</span> $P$.)
  * <b>Constants</b>:
      * <b>Additive truth</b>: $\top$,
      * <b>Additive falsity</b>: $\mathbf{0}$,
      * <b>Multiplicative truth</b>: $\mathbf{1}$, and
      * <b>Multiplicative falsity</b>: $\bot$.

  To derive logical statements, the following inference rules are deemed valid:[^4] (The variables $\Gamma,\Lambda,\Theta$ and $\Delta$ indicate general contexts.)
  * <b>Identity*</b>: If $P$ is a proposition, then $P\vdash P$.
  * <b>Exchange*</b>: Sequents remain valid under permutations:

    \end{aligned}\,.
  $$

  Note that these negation rules allow to write any sequent in a one-sided form, e.g. $\vdash\Gamma^\ast,P$. Moreover, these two rules also imply that $P\cong P^{\ast\ast}$.<br><br>

        \hline
        P\dualampersand Q\vdash\Delta\dualampersand\Theta\ 
    \end{aligned}\,,
  \end{gather}
  i.e. the two multiplicative connectives could be interchanged (this fact will be recalled in <a href = "#CategoricalSemantics">the section</a> on categorical semantics).<br><br>

  * <b>Truth and falsity</b>:
  
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Gamma\vdash\top &\qquad \mathbf{0}\vdash\Theta\\

        ?P&\vdash\Theta

  </div>

  The inference rules with an asterisk are the structural rules. Note that a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-elimination_theorem" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">cut-elimination theorem</a> holds and, hence, the identity and cut rules for general propositions can be derived from the rules above.<br><br>

  Linear implication is characterized as follows:
  
  $$P\vdash Q \iff \vdash P^\perp\dualampersand Q \iff \vdash P\multimap Q\,.$$

  [^4]: The form of these rules heavily depends on the exchange rule (the second item). Care must be taken if this rule is weakened.

<p style = "height: 200pt;color: orange;vertical-align: middle;display: table-cell">Will be completed!</p>

  The relation between linear logic and quantum logic and, more specifically, the no-cloning and no-deletion theorems is given by the absence of the weakening and contraction rules. The contraction rule implies that given a sequent $\Gamma\otimes\Gamma\vdash\Theta$ also the sequent $\Gamma\vdash\Theta$ holds. Especially with the next section in mind, this means that if one needs two copies of $\Gamma$ to derive $\Theta$, the contraction rule would imply that one copy actually suffices. Hence, a copy operation should exist, which is exactly forbidden in quantum mechanics by the no-cloning theorem.<br><br>

  Similarly, the weakening rule would imply that one can freely adjoin any proposition to a sequent, i.e. $\Gamma\vdash\Theta$ would imply $\Gamma\otimes P\vdash\Theta$. However, this means that, although $P$ is not required, it is still 'used up' and, hence, discarded during the process. In quantum mechanics, this would violate the no-deleting theorem. Do not that the following inference is valid:

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \Gamma\vdash&\Theta \qquad\qquad P\vdash P\\
      \hline
      &\Gamma\otimes P\vdash\Theta\otimes P\,,
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  where the proposition $P$ is simply passed along. (This follows from the rules for identities and multiplicative conjunction.)<br><br>

  The exponential modalities change this behaviour. The modal types $!P$ and $?P$ (or rather $(?P)^\ast$) behave like (classic) intuitionistic propositions in that contraction and weakening hold on the left-hand side of sequents. This means that these can be copied (or discarded) as many times as one needs.

<hr id = "ResourceInterpretation">
<div class = "nav-block"><div class = "side">Resource interpretation</div></div>

  So, one has four connectives: $\otimes$, $\dualampersand$, $\&$ and $\oplus$. Although they satisfy vaguely similar rules compared to conjunction and disjunction in classical logic, it would be nice to give a more hands-down interpretation. This will be achieved through the notion of 'resources'. Especially the 'linear' aspect will be elucidated this way.<br><br>

  To this end, one can interpret a proposition $P$ as a 'basket of resources', e.g. 1kg of apples or 1 dollar. The inference rules for the logical connectives can then be interpreted as follows:
  * Additive conjunction Eq. $\eqref{additive_conjunction}$: If one can use either of the resources $P,Q$ to produce $\Theta$, then having a storage with both of them is also sufficient to produce $\Theta$. The connective $\&$ signifies that both resources are separately available.
  * Additive disjunction Eq. $\eqref{additive_disjunction}$:
  * Multiplicative conjunction:
  * Multiplicative disjunction:

<hr id = "CategoricalSemantics">
<div class = "nav-block"><div class = "side">Categorical semantics</div></div>

  The categorical semantics of a logical theory is given by a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">category</a> $\mathbf{C}$ and an assignment of logical formulas $\Gamma$ to objects $[\Gamma]\in\mathrm{ob}(\mathbf{C})$ such that a general sequent $\Gamma\vdash\Theta$ corresponds to a morphism $[\Gamma]\rightarrow[\Theta]$. (For brevity, the square brackets, indicating a <i>denotation</i>, will be omitted in the remainder of this post.) Moreover, logical operations should also correspond to an associated operation (i.e. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">functor</a>) in the category of $\mathbf{C}$.<br><br>
  
  As noted in the section on <a href = "#SequentCalculus">sequent calculus</a>, a sequent $\Gamma_1,\ldots,\Gamma_m\vdash\Theta_1,\ldots,\Theta_n$ is equivalent to the sequent $\Gamma_1\land\cdots\land\Gamma_m\vdash\Theta_1\lor\cdots\lor\Theta_n$. It follows that one needs a category $\mathbf{C}$ that admits a notion of conjunction and one of disjunction and, moreover (at least for classical logic), these need to interact nicely (e.g. commutativity, distributivity, ...). It turns out that the correct environment for classical logic is given by <i>Cartesian closed categories</i>, i.e. categories with a notion of product (interpreting logical conjunction), coproducts (interpreting logical disjunction) and, very importantly, an internal form of function spaces (interpreting implication):

  $$\mathbf{C}\bigl(X\otimes Y,Z\bigr)\cong\mathbf{C}\bigl(X,[Y,Z]\bigr)\,.$$

  Now, an important result for Cartesian (closed) categories is the existence of diagonal morphisms $\Delta_X:X\rightarrow X\times X$ and augmentations $\varepsilon_X:X\rightarrow\mathbf{1}$. These, heuristically, correspond to copying and deleting data. But, remember the discussion from <a href = "#QuantumPrimer">quantum information theory</a> and <a href = "#LinearLogic">linear logic</a>, where the main point was that copying (or cloning) and deleting are not allowed. It follows that the notion of Cartesian category will have to be generalized. To this end, the different fragments of linear logic will be considered separately, starting with the multiplicative fragment.<br><br>

  Multiplicative linear logic (MLL)[^2] refers to the fragment of linear logic where only the multiplicative connectives (and associated constants) play a role: $\otimes$, &#8523;, $\mathbf{1}$, $\bot$ and $\multimap$. The bare multiplicative structure, i.e. conjunction $\otimes$ and truth $\mathbf{1}$, together with the identity (and associativity) rule correspond to a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">monoidal category</a>. Adding the exchange rule, in one way or another, leads to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braided_monoidal_category" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">braided</a> or <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">symmetric</a> monoidal categories. For implication or negation, one has some freedom as one can be derived from the other (as far as classical logic is concerned). In this post, negation will be taken to be fundamental. Classically, negation is an involution: $\lnot\lnot p=p$ and, accordingly, the corresponding functor should be involutive as well. The inference rule 
  
  $$\Gamma\vdash\Theta\iff\vdash\Gamma^*,\Theta\iff\vdash\Gamma^*\dualampersand\Theta.$$

  Note that the first sequent can also be considered as defining (linear) implication:

  $$\Gamma\vdash\Theta\iff\vdash\Gamma\multimap\Theta\,.$$

  At the same time, using the inference rules of negation, one also has

  $$\Gamma\vdash\Theta\iff\Gamma\otimes\Theta^*\vdash\iff\vdash(\Gamma\otimes\Theta^*)^*\,.$$

  Taking these together gives the following relations (which is essentially de Morgan duality):
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    X\dualampersand Y &\cong (X^\ast\otimes Y^\ast)^\ast, \\
    X\multimap Y &\cong X^\ast\dualampersand Y\,
   \end{aligned}
  $$

  The categorical notion reflecting these structures is that of <b id = "AutonomousCategory">$\ast$-autonomous categories</b>, i.e. symmetric monoidal categories with an equivalence $\ast:\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}}\rightarrow\mathbf{C}$, i.e. $\mathbf{C}(X,Y)\cong\mathbf{C}(Y^\ast,X^\ast)$, such that[^3]

  $$\mathbf{C}(X,Y)\cong\mathbf{C}\bigl(\mathbf{1},(X\otimes Y^*)^*\bigr)\,.$$

  Note that, although this definition does not require $\ast$ to be involutive, it can be derived from the structure that is present. The presence of $\dualampersand$ is a more general fact for $\ast$-autonomous categories. Every such category admits a second monoidal structure induced by de Morgan duality! (For the true lovers of category theory: $\mathbf{C}$ is <i>compact closed</i> if and only if the two structures coincide.) The fact that every $\ast$-autonomous category admits two (de Morgan) dual monoidal structures is a restatement of the observation made in Eq. $\eqref{two_tensors}$.<br><br>

[^2]: Here, referring to the classical version. Intuitionistic logic will be treated further on.
[^3]: This also shows that $\mathbf{C}$ has to be closed.

  Now, the next step is adding the additive fragment, leading to 'MALL'. From the inference rules of the additive connectives, one is quickly led to the intuition that the underlying structure is that of a Cartesian category (i.e. one with finite products). To model the additive conjunction, one could also expect the requirement that finite coproducts need to exist, but it can be shown that this follows (again by de Morgan duality) from the existence of finite products. Moreover, although the existence of products does imply that diagonal morphism and augementations exist, this does not mean that weakening and contraction rules should hold with respect to the additive connectives, since sequents are interpreted through Eq. $\eqref{general_sequent}$. So, to interpret MALL, one needs a $\ast$-autonomous category with finite products.<br><br>

  The last step, which turns out to be the most subtle one, are the exponential modalities, which turn 'linear sequents' into classical intuitionistic ones (since weakening and contraction hold for these modal sequents).
