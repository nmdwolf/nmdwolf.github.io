In 2019, I successfully defended my Master's thesis on <i>matrix product states</i> and <i>symmetry-protected phases topological phases</i>. Now, almost 5 years later, I think it is the perfect time to write down a (short) introduction and overview of what I did during my thesis and how it relates to various fields of science.

This post is structured as follows:
* Short introduction to (algebraic[^1]) quantum mechanics.
* Why Matrix Product States?
* What is topological order?
* How is group cohomology involved?
* How to include spatial symmetries?
* Future perspectives

[^1]: There are two formalisms for quantum mechanics. One based on functional analysis, following Schrödinger, and one based on matrices (or, more generally, <i>operators</i>), following Heisenberg. We will adopt the second approach.

Whereas in classical physics, a physical system is completely characterized by specifying the position $\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^3$ and momentum $\vec{p}\in\mathbb{R}^3$ of all particles, a system in quantum mechanics is described by a state vector $\|\psi\rangle\in\mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the vector space of all possible states. For example, the space of a two-state system such as the electron, which has an <i>up</i> state $\|\uparrow\rangle$ and a <i>down</i> state $\|\downarrow\rangle$, is given by the vector space $\mathbb{C}^2$.[^2]

[^2]: To be entirely correct, we should be working with its projectivization $\mathbb{C}P^2$.
