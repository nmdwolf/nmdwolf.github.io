Last "This month's read" post was about probability theory. This month's post will cover something completely different: electromagnetism (and some generalizations).

Classical electromagnetism is entirely characterized by <b id = "Maxwellsequations">Maxwell's equations</b>[^1]

    <div style = "display: inline-block; margin-right: 10%">

together with the <b id = "Lorentzforce">Lorentz force</b>
\begin{gather}
    \vector{F} = q(\vector{E}+\vector{v}\times\vector{B})\,.
\end{gather}
In this equations, $\vector{E}$ and $\vector{B}$ denote the electric and magnetic fields, respectivey, and $q$ denotes the charge. Note that we work in natural units where both $c=1=\varepsilon_0$.<br><br>

[^1]: Sometimes also called the <b>Maxwell&ndash;Heaviside equations</b> because it was Heaviside who put them in this more elegant form!

To better understand the theory of electromagnetism and eventually quantize it, we first have to understand it a bit better. The first step will be to uncover its 'gauge structure'. This structure is related to certain symmetries and redundancies in the definition of the electric and magnetic field.<br><br>

First, start with Gauss's law \eqref{B_gauss} for the magnetic field. This equation, through the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">Helmholtz decomposition</a>, shows that

$$
    \vector{B} = \nabla\times\vector{A}
$$

for some vector potential $\vector{A}:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$. Inserting this in Faraday's law \eqref{faraday} then gives

\begin{gather}
    \label{electric_potential}
    \vector{E} = -\nabla\varphi - \frac{\partial\vector{A}}{\partial t}
\end{gather}

for some smooth function $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Now, due to the properties of the $\nabla$-operator, the choice of potentials $(\varphi,\vector{A})$ is not unique. For every smooth function $\chi:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, we can perform the transformations

$$
    \varphi\longrightarrow\varphi-\frac{\partial\chi}{\partial t} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \vector{A}\longrightarrow\vector{A}+\nabla\chi
$$

without actually altering the electric and magnetic fields. This freedom will be essential once we consider quantum effects! However, first, let us just consider the electromagnetic potentials. In classical mechanics, most forces that we encounter are of a specific kind: they are <b id = "Conservativeforce">conservative</b>:

$$
    \vector{F} = -\nabla V
$$

for a smooth <b id = "Potential">potential</b> $V:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. (Note the similarity with the electric field.) We could now wonder whether the Lorentz force is also of this type. There is, however, immediately an issue. Conservative forces only depend on the position $\vector{r}$, while the Lorentz force depends on the velocity $\vector{v}\equiv\dot{\vector{r}}$ as well! Luckily, there is a beautiful solution. We can generalize the notion of conservative forces to more general settings involving higher-order derivatives of the position (so even beyond the velocity). To this end, we need to say goodbye to the Newtonian realm and let the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics enter the stage.<br><br>

Newton's second law

$$
    \vector{F} = \frac{d\vector{p}}{dt}
$$

is equivalent to the following set of equations, called the <b>Euler&ndash;Lagrange equations</b>,

$$
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}^i}\,,
$$

where $L:=T-V$ is the <b id = "Lagrangian">Lagrangian</b> (function), the difference between the kinetic energy and the potential energy, and the $q^i$ are the 'generalized coordinates' (these are just the preferred coordinates in which we want to solve the dynamics of the system). In a slightly less common form, they read

$$
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial q^i} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial T}{\partial\dot{q}^i} = Q_i\,,
$$

with

$$
    Q_i := \vector{F}\cdot\frac{\partial\vector{r}}{\partial q^i}
$$

the <b>generalized forces</b>. The operator

$$
    \delta_{\text{EL}} := \sum_{i=1}^k\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial}{\partial\dot{q}^i}
$$

is also called the <b id = "Euler-Lagrangeoperator">Euler&ndash;Lagrange operator</b> or <b id = "Variationalderivative">variational derivative</b>. It follows that any generalized force of the form

$$
    Q = \delta_{\text{EL}}U
$$

for a generalized potential $U\equiv U(\vector{r},\vector{v},t)$ will lead to valid Euler&ndash;Lagrange equations. The fun part is now to check that the Lorentz force is exactly of this form, with

$$
    U(\vector{r},\vector{v},t) = q\bigl(V(\vector{r},t) - \vector{v}\cdot\vector{A}(\vector{r},t)\bigr)\,.
$$

(This will be left as an exercise to the reader &#x1F609;.) Now, to go from the Lagrangian framework to the Hamiltonian framework, which is preferred for quantum mechanics, one needs to derive (conjugate) momenta from the Lagrangian $L=T-V$:

$$
    p_i := \frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}^i}\,.
$$

For usual potentials, the only contribution comes from the kinetic energy. However, since the Lorentz potential is velocity dependent, an additional term is obtained:

$$
    p_i = m\dot{q}^i + qA_i\,.
$$

It follows that the conjugate momenta are not equal to the kinetic momenta!

<hr id = "QuantumMechanics">
<div class = "nav-block"><div class = "side">Quantum mechanics</div></div>

In quantum mechanics, the fundamental equation is Schrödinger's equation:

$$
    i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi = \widehat{H}\psi\,,
$$

with $\widehat{H}$ the Hamiltonian operator. In the vacuum, for free particles, this Hamiltonian only consists of a kinetic part:

$$
    \widehat{H}_{\text{free}} := \frac{\widehat{p}^2}{2m}\,.
$$

Now, a charged particle in an electric field has a potential energy equal to $V=q\varphi$, where $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is the scalar potential from Eq. \eqref{electric_potential}. The question becomes what to do with the vector potential? Does it also play a role? Well, as noted above, the conjugate momenta obtain a term proportional to $\vector{A}$. So, to obtain the kinetic momenta, we simply have to subtract this contribution:

$$
    \widehat{H}_{\text{EM}} = \frac{(\widehat{p}-q\vector{A})^2}{2m}+q\varphi\,.
$$

This substitution $\widehat{p}\longrightarrow\widehat{p}-q\vector{A}$ is called <b id = "Minimalcoupling">minimal coupling</b>. Under (canonical) quantization, the conjugate momentum $\widehat{p}_i$ is given by the differential operator $-i\partial_i$ (where we again use natural units with $\hbar=1$). By analogy, when incorporating an interaction such as electromagnetism, one introduces the <b id = "Covariantderivative">covariant derivative</b>:

$$
    \nabla_i := \partial_i - iqA_i\,.
$$

In this way, the electromagnetically coupled Schrödinger equation becomes

$$
    i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi = \left(-\frac{\nabla^2}{2m}+q\varphi\right)\psi\,.
$$

In fact, if one works entirely in terms of 4-vectors $x^\mu,p^\mu$, etc., the electromagnetically coupled Schrödinger equation is simply the free one written in 'covariant' form. To this end, define the 4-momentum and electromagnetic 4-potential as follows:

$$
    p^\mu\equiv(E,\widehat{p}) \qquad\text{and}\qquad A^\mu\equiv(\phi,\vector{A})\,.
$$

In turn, this gives the covariant derivative

\begin{gather}
    \label{covariant_derivative}
    \nabla_\mu := \partial_\mu + iqA_\mu\,,
\end{gather}

where indices are lowered (and raised) with the (mostly-minus[^2]) Minkowski metric $\eta\equiv(+1,-1,-1,-1)$:

$$
    (\xi_0,\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)=(\xi^0,-\xi^1,-\xi^2,-\xi^3)\,.
$$

[^2]: Two (equivalent) conventions exist: mostly-pluses and mostly-minus. The former is mainly used by particle physicists, whereas the latter is mainly used in (general) relativity.

With these conventions, one can see that the 'covariant' Schrödinger equation

$$
    -i\nabla_t\psi = -\frac{\nabla^2}{2m}\psi
$$

captures both the free-particle case when $\nabla_\mu=\partial_\mu$ and the electromagnetic case when Eq. \eqref{covariant_derivative} holds!

    <div class = "side">Note</div>
    The reason why 'covariant' has been put in between quotation marks twice now is that this equation is actually not what one would really call covariant. To be entirely covariant, i.e. invarant under general coordinate transformations, 4-vectors (and operators) should always occur as a whole. For example, in the Schrödinger equation, the temporal component occurs linearly on the left-hand side, whereas the spatial component quadratically on the right-hand side. This is not truly covariant!
