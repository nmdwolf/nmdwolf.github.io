One of the most influential websites for me was <i>John Baez</i>'s <a href = "https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/twf.html" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">This Week's Finds</a>. I learned many things from these blog posts and it helped me realize which scientific or mathematical topics interested me most. Lately, I have been spending quite some time studying several topics, usually a few weeks each, and it occurred to me that it might be fun and interesting to write about them (even though everything hasn't been worked out yet).
