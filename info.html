      I am a PhD student at the University of Ghent (UGent) in Belgium in the <a href="https://kermit.ugent.be/" target="_blank">KERMIT</a> research group. I started in February 2020 (just before Covid-19 hit) and my main research topic is Uncertainty Quantifiction (UQ).

      <h1> Background </h1>

      In September 2014 I started a Bachelor of Science in Physics & Astronomy at UGent. After 5 years I succesfully obtained my Master with a thesis on "Spatial Symmetries and Symmetry Breaking with Matrix Product States" under supervision of Prof. Frank Verstraete. This thesis is situated in the branch of theoretical physics and most of my current academic interests are still strongly tied to that topic. In particular I am interested in:
      <ul>
        <li>Topology (algebraic topology, cohomology theory, homotopy theory, ...)</li>
        <li>Differential Geometry (manifolds, bundle theory, ...)</li>
        <li>Category Theory (higher structures, topos theory, ...)</li>
      </ul>
      Although for most people these might only superficially be related, they all play a very important roll in the area of Gauge Theory in theoretical physics. (This should be explained in a future blogpost.)
