      <h1 style="margin-top:0">Welcome to my site</h1>

      I started building this site for two reasons. First of all because I like trying something new and it had been years since I last toyed around
      with building a website, and secondly because I wanted a place where I could share my academic interests with the rest of the world.
      I am well aware that I will probably not reach a lot of people, but even if nobody reads my blogs, it still makes for a nice place to write up stuff for myself
      and see which parts I do not fully understand.

      <br><br>
      I'm using of MathJax to typeset all equations as to obtain a nice LateX feel: $$S[\psi] := \int_M\overline{\psi}(i/\!\!\!\partial-m)\psi\,\mathrm{Vol}_M$$ However, not all operators or packages are implemented in MathJax, so it is possible that certain formulas do not look as clean as they would in an ordinary paper.
