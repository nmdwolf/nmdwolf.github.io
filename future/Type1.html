    <div id="content">

      This blog post wil be the first in a series of posts concerning the applications of "Type Theory".
      In the spirit of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computational+trilogy">computational trinitarianism</a> the posts
      will each mainly focus on a specific subject (computer sciences, mathematics and physics). Since I'm doing a PhD in machine learning (and, hence, programming most of my time) and because formal types
      are most frequently encountered in computer sciences, I will begin my story there.<br><br>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>

      Most modern programming languages can be divided into two classes (yes, I know there is much more out there): object-oriented programming and functional programming.
      People working with (statically typed) object-oriented are pretty used to the whole typing business.
      Every object you are working with has a fixed type, be it an atomic type or a composite one.
      The benefit of this approach that you can avoid a lot of bugs in the code. Just as in real life, where you know the functionality of every object (in theory),
      in a typed language you cannot call functions on objects of the wrong type. The system (IDE, compiler or interpreter) knows whether a given type supports the function that you want to call.

      <div class="note">
        Consider the following example in Java-style syntax:
        <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;justify-content:space-around;align-items:center">
          <p style="font-family:\"Courier New\";width: 50%">
            class House $\{$<br>
              &emsp;int doors;<br>
              &emsp;int windows;<br>
              &emsp;boolean windowsOpen;<br><br>

              &emsp;House$($int d, int w$)$ $\{$<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;this.doors $=$ d;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;this.windows $=$ w;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;this.windowsOpen $=$ false;<br>
              &emsp;$\}$<br><br>

              &emsp;openWindows$()$ $\{$<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;this.windowsOpen $=$ true;<br>
              &emsp;$\}$<br><br>

              &emsp;closeWindows$()$ $\{$<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;this.windowsOpen $=$ false;<br>
              &emsp;$\}$<br>
            $\}$
          </p>
          <p style="width:40%">
            This code snippet represents a type (class) "House" whose instances have three properties (fields), the number of doors and windows and whether the windows are open or not.<br><br>
            This class implements a constructor function which, given two integers, constructs a object of type "House" with the given number of doors and windows.
            Moreover, the class also implements two functions, one which opens the windows and one which closes the windows.<br><br>
            It is clear that calling this function on an object of another type, for example "Apple" would not make sense
            and typed languages would also throw an error if you would try this, since they know that these functions belong to the class "House" alone.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      For example, in real life you would not expect to ask what the first letter of a number is. Likewise, in any self-respecting typed language this will also not be possible.
      Functional programming languages have a completely different flavour. The focus does not lie on the data structures, but on the functions between them.
      In fact, in purely functional languages, aside from some basic atomic types, all complex data structures will be built from functions.

      <div class="note">
        Consider the following example in Haskell-style syntax:
        <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;justify-content:space-around;align-items:center">
          <p style="font-family:\"Courier New\";width: 50%">
            type House $=$ House int int boolean<br><br>

            openWindows :: House $\rightarrow$ House<br>
            openWindows $($House d w _$)$ $=$ House d w true<br><br>

            closeWindows :: House $\rightarrow$ House<br>
            closeWindows $($House d w _$)$ $=$ House d w false<br><br>
          </p>
          <p style="width:40%">
            This code snippet represents the same type "House" as the previous example. However, contrary to the OOB-like syntax
            in this example the type itself is a simple data structure. It has not internal structure whatsoever. The real structure is given by the functions
            that are implemented.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      Further on in this post we will see that type theory as used in mathematics resembles the Haskell-style example much more than the Java-style one.
      However, the object-oriented case was considered since this is more the kind of language that we use in our every day lives.
      The functional approach, where we mainly consider functions between objects is the one that often pops up in science, logic, etc.
      As such it makes sense that a formalization of this notion will also play an important role in these subjects.<br><br>

      But, of course, you might wonder what is wrong with the current axiomatization of mathematics. After all, most people seem to be using a typed system already.
      Sets with set functions between them, groups with group morphisms between them, etc. However, once you delve into the foundations of current mathematics, you find some strange results.
      Most modern mathematicians use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Frenkel axioms</a> (usually with the the axiom of choice),
      where everything is built up from the basic notion of a set. For example the natural numbers are inductively defind as follows (the so-called <b>von Neumann ordinals</b>):
      \begin{align}
        0&:=\emptyset\\
        1&:=\{\emptyset\}=\{0\}\\
        2&:=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}=\{0,1\}\\
        \vdots
      \end{align}
      Sadly this definition has some really weird consequences. For example, every natural number is an element of any greater one: $m\leq n\implies m\subseteq n$.
      By constructing everything out of sets, we allow ourselves to apply set functions to everything, even if we know that it doesnt really make sense to do that.

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      The language of type theory is based on <b>natural deduction</b>. This deductive system works very much like our daily reasoning.
      We start from a couple of statements that we know are true, called <b>judgements</b>, and from those derive some new statements.
      (It is important to note that the truth value of these statements are not to be proven in the theory itself. They live in the "metatheory".)
      For every type $T$ we have four types or rules:
      <ol class="list">
        <li><b>Formation rule</b>: This is the most basic rule. It says based on which pre-existing types, the new one can be introduced.
          \begin{gather}
            A:\type\quad B:\type\quad\cdots\\
            \hline
            T(A,B,\cdots):\type
          \end{gather}</li>
        <li><b>Introduction rule</b>: Where the formation rules says which types are required,
            the introduction rule says how a new term can be constructed from terms of those types. This is also called a "constructor".
            \begin{gather}
              T(A,B,\cdots):\type\quad a:A\quad b:B\quad\cdots\\
              \hline
              T(a,b,\cdots):T(A,B,\cdots)
            \end{gather}</li>
        <li><b>Elimination rule</b>: These rules say what we can do with a type.</li>
        <li><b>Computation rule</b>: These give "explicit" implementations of the elimination rules.</li>
      </ol>
      Putting these four rules next to the code examples from the previous section, we can say the following.
      In the functional example, the first line is exactly the formation rule of the type "House". It tells us that we can construct a House given two integers and a boolean.
      The introduction rule is left implicit since the objects are simply data structures and no further logic is required during object construction.
      In the OOB example on the other hand, the formation rule is implicit in the contructor header and the constructor itself is exactly the introduction rule.
      For the elimination and computation rules, the functional example is clear. The first line of the function definition,
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_signature">function signature</a> tells us the input and output types.
      Then, the second line, the implementation, tells us to what the constructors of the input types are mapped to.
      Term elimination and computation in the OOB example is analoguous to formation and introduction. The elimination rule is given by the function signature,
      while the computation rule is given by the actual implementation between braces.

      <div class="note">
        A canonical example of the rules in natural deduction is the product type. The formation rule reads $$A,B:\type\vdash A\times B:\type.$$
        The introduction rule states that for every $a:A$ and $b:B$ one can form their product: $$a:A,b:B\vdash(a,b):A\times B.$$
        The basic elimination and computation rules are given by the projections: $$p:A\times B\vdash\pi_1(p):A\qquad\qquad p:A\times B\vdash\pi_2(p):B$$
        and $$a:A,b:B\vdash\pi_1(a,b)=a\qquad\qquad a:A,b:B\vdash\pi_2(a,b)=b.$$
      </div>

      One of the most important types in type theory is the function type. We will present two kinds of function types.
      The ordinary function type and the dependent product type, where in the latter the ouput type can depend on the input arguments.
      (Here, one technically needs a <b>type family</b> or <b>dependent type</b> which is a function type into the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+universe">type universe</a>. So, the right column can only be formed after the left.)
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center">
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            A:\type\quad B:\type\\
            \hline
            A\rightarrow B:\type.
          \end{gather}
        </div>
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            A:\type\quad a:A\vdash B(a):\type\\
            \hline
            \prod_{a:A}B(a):\type.
          \end{gather}
        </div>
      </div>
      These represents the type of functions going from elements of $A$ to elements of $B$. The introduction rule for function types is usually given
      by a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lambda-calculus">$\lambda$-expression</a>:
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center">
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            a:A\vdash f(a):B\\
            \hline
            \lambda(a:A).f(a):A\rightarrow B.
          \end{gather}
        </div>
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            a:A\vdash f(a):B(a)\\
            \hline
            \lambda(a:A).f(a):\prod_{a:A}B(a).
          \end{gather}
        </div>
      </div>
      Often, a $\lambda$-expression is shortened to $\lambda(x:A).f$ or even $\lambda x.f$ when the type is clear from the context.
      The elimination rules read
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center">
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            f:A\rightarrow B\quad a:A\\
            \hline
            f(a):B.
          \end{gather}
        </div>
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            f:\prod_{a:A}B(a)\quad a':A\\
            \hline
            f(a'):B(a').
          \end{gather}
        </div>
      </div>
      The computation rule, called <b>$\beta$-reduction</b>, is given by substituting $a$ for $x$ in the expression of $f$:
      $$\lambda x.f(a)\equiv f[a/x].$$ Note that we used the symbol $\equiv$ instead of the plain equality sign. This has to do with an importance difference between
      <b>judgemental</b> or <b>definitional equality</b>, denoted by $\equiv$, and <b>propositional equality</b>, denoted by $=$.
      As with judgements, the former is not something that one can prove within the theory. It is a given fact.
      The latter, however, can be either true or false and should be proven (we come back to equalities later on in the series.)
      <br><br>

      This might all sound a bit vague and abstract, so let us consider two simple examples: products and numbers.
      From the previous example about product types we know that there should (at least) exist two functions for any product type: the projections.
      $\lambda$-abstractions of these functions could read $\lambda(a,b).a$ and $\lambda(a,b).b$ with the computation rules $\lambda(a,b).a(c,d)equiv c$ and $\lambda(a,b).b(c,d)\equiv d$.
      Here is also a nice place to introduce a more general way of defining functions out of a given type, the <b>recursion</b> and <b>induction principles</b>.
      A common concept in computer sciences is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a>, where functions $f:A\times B\rightarrow C$ out of a product are related to functions $g:A\rightarrow(B\rightarrow C)$ into functions.
      In type theory we use a similar idea:
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center">
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            g:A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\\
            \hline
            f:A\times B\rightarrow C
          \end{gather}
        </div>
        <div>
          \begin{gather}
            g:A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\quad a:A\quad b:B\\
            \hline
            f(a,b):\equiv g(a)(b):C
          \end{gather}
        </div>
      </div>
      Instead of adding these rules for every function, we can define them in a universal way:
      $$\mathrm{rec}_{A\times B}:\prod_{C:\mathcal{U}}(A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C)\rightarrow A\times B\rightarrow C$$ with
      $$\mathrm{rec}_{A\times B}\big(C,g,(a,b)\big):\equiv g(a)(b).$$ This is called the recursion principle and $\mathrm{rec}$ is called the <b>recursor</b>.

      <div class="note">
        We can also return to the example of the natural numbers. The idea of defining them recursively was not at all a bad idea.
        In the end, the natural numbers are defined by their sequential nature. The formation rule is simple: $$\vdash\mathbb{N}:\type.$$ No pre-existsing types are required.
        Two introduction rules exist: one for the zero element and one for succession. $$\vdash 0:\mathbb{N}\qquad\qquad n:\mathbb{N}\vdash\mathrm{succ}(n):\mathbb{N}$$
        To define functions out of $\mathbb{N}$ one can again use recursion. Functions $\mathbb{N}\rightarrow T$ are defined from a starting point $t_0:T$ and a recursion rule $s:\mathbb{N}\times T\rightarrow T$:
        \begin{align}
          f(0) &:= t_0\\
          f(\mathrm{succ}(n)) &:= s(n,f(n)).
        \end{align}
      </div>
