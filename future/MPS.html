    <title>Frieze groups and MPS</title>

    <div id="content">

      In the final year of my Master in Physics and Astronomy (2018-2019), I did a thesis on the theoretical properties of a specific algebraic ansatz for condensed matter physics: matrix-product states (<b>MPS</b> for short). Fast-forward to 2022, I receive a mail from the group of my (Master) thesis supervisor that they are continuing the work initiated during my thesis research and want to include me as a coauthor. For this I am very grateful. Part of my still regretted (or even regrets) that I am not part of the physics community anymore, but through this paper my legacy will go on. Earlier this month, the paper got published and this seems like a good moment to write down a little summary of what we did. 

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <h3>Group cohomology</h3>

      <h3>Frieze groups</h3>
